# CougSat1

This project covers my contributions the Washington State University Cougs in Space Club (2018-2020) and is part of NASA's [CubeSat Launch Initiative](https://nasa.gov/kennedy/launch-services-program/cubesat-launch-initiative).
A CubeSat is a miniature satellite intended for conducting scientific investigations in space.

## Description

There are three sections in this project:
1. [Attitude Determination](attitude_estimation): algorithm to estimate attitude of the satellite ([Readme](docs/attitudeDetermination.md))
2. [Engineering Drawings](engineering_drawings): drawings for existing CubeSat parts drawn to GD&T Drafting Standard ([Readme](docs/engDrawings.md))
3. [Helmholtz Coil Structure](helmholtz_coil_structure): a testing structure to produce a 3-dimensional region of uniform magnetic field ([Readme](docs/helmholtz.md))

An introductory document I wrote for new team members to the ADCS team is included under [docs](docs)
