# CougSat1

This project covers my contributions the Washington State University Cougs in Space Club (2018-2020) and is part of NASA's [CubeSat Launch Initiative](https://nasa.gov/kennedy/launch-services-program/cubesat-launch-initiative).
A CubeSat is a miniature satellite intended for conducting scientific investigations in space.
