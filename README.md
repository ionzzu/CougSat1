# CougSat1

This project covers my contributions the Washington State University Cougs in Space Club (2018-2020) and is part of NASA's [CubeSat Launch Initiative](nasa.gov/kennedy/launch-services-program/cubesat-launch-initiative).
A CubeSat is a miniature satellite intended for conducting scientific investigations in space.

## Description

There are three sections in this project:
1. [Attitude Determination and Control System (ADCS)](github.com/ionzzu/CougSat1/tree/main/ADCS): orients the satellite to a desirable position
2. [Engineering Drawings](github.com/ionzzu/CougSat1/tree/main/Engineering-Drawings): drawings for existing CubeSat parts drawn to GD&T Drafting Standard
3. [Helmholtz Coil Structure](github.com/ionzzu/CougSat1/tree/main/Helmholtz-Coil-Structure): a testing structure to produce a 3-dimensional region of uniform magnetic field
